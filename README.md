### üí° Interacting with the Bot

- Mention the bot in any channel to chat with it:

   ```
   @Botname Hello!
   ```
- Slash commands are also available, e.g.:
  ```
  /botname ...
  ```

## üë• User Info Synchronization Logic

The bot automatically builds a combined list of user data from **Discord** and an optional **CSV file**.

### üîß How It Works

1. The bot collects all members who are currently **online** or **idle** on Discord.  
   Each Discord user contributes at least these two fields:
   - `Discord` ‚Üí their display name  
   - `Discord ID` ‚Üí their unique Discord user ID

2. If a CSV file path is defined in `.env` under `USERNAMES_PATH`,  
   the bot also loads that file and merges the entries using the `Discord ID` field as the key.

3. The CSV file **must include** a column named `Discord ID`.  
   All other columns are **optional** and will be integrated automatically if present  
   (for example, `Discord`, `Name`, `Minecraft`, or `Email`).

4. The final member list will include **all Discord users and all CSV entries**, even if one source is missing data for some users.  
   Overlapping fields from Discord take priority over CSV data.
